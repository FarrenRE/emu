# EMU: Email Module Utility

Once upon a time there was a marketing team who wanted to be more efficient. Lots of time was spent assembling EDMs, so a certain savvy individual hatched a plan to 
transform this menial task into something a little more convenient for all.

This app will put together pre-defined modules (HTML blocks) in a variety of configurations (at the user's discretion).
